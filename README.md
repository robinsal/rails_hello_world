# Hello World Rails App

A roundabout way to host an HTML file with the string "hello, world!"
Ruby 2.6.3
Rails 5.2.3

## Purpose
This is my first Rails application. To get it up and running, I had to configure
the Gemfile, alter the application (so that it posted "hello, world!"), and deploy
the application using Heroku.

## See the Result
Heroku is a cloud platform service allowing users to host Rails applications (among other things).
Here is my completed Hello World application:
